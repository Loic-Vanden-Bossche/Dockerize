# Dockerize

Dockerize is a school project that is a web application offering a reader to save books
that he has read during his life, in his virtual library.

The goal of this project is to learn how to use development tools such as [Github](https://github.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation

At the root of the project you can use the command :

```
npm install -g pnpm

pnpm install

npm start
```

to launch the Docker containers


## Front-End

The application front is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) with typescript langage

## Back-end

The application back is based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

## Usage

## Testing

## Caveat

The Hot Reloading is not working for now with docker for the front-end
